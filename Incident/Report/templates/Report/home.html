       <p>Emergency Response Teams have to make an incident report after any incident or drill. These reports are made on paper and include easily forgotten or incorrectly remembered information such as start time of incident.<br> <br>

        I took the initiative to find out the information that is required on a report and created a web form that can be accessed from the phone of anyone. I used python and django to create basic forms that can be submitted to the server and saved to the reports page so it can be used to make paper reports after the incident.<br>
<br>
        Using this the incident command ( typically first on the call ) can instantly start tracking the information needed for a report. This allows for both an easy way for incident command to document what is happening for the report but also allows them to have a structure of what they need to do in the situation so that the stress of it doesnâ€™t hinder response practices.</p>
